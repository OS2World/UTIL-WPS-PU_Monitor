Introduction</H3>
<P>PU Monitor is a general purpose system monitoring tool for OS/2 PM. The
idea of implementing such a tool, came to me when I looked into "Settings"
page of Warp Center, and found there was nothing of interest to me except
CPU usage. Other available system monitors couldn't meet my needs for different
reasons and I decided to write another one. The number of parameters monitored
is limited now to CPU usage, TCP/IP traffic, available memory, uptime,
and POP3 mailbox monitor. In version 2.0 connection monitor was also added,
which has no screen presentation and can be used as custom version of ping
utility able to inform you that connection to some site is lost.

<P>Because the first version of PU Monitor was completely satisfactory
for me, I have stopped further development. Later this version was made
available to public and I received a lot of feedback from users of first
version of PU Monitor, that's why I resumed development. The current version
significantly differs from first one. This version is completely rewritten,
uses multithreaded design to gather information, buffered drawing for smooth
and flicker free look, greatly improved user interface, support for many
graph types, settings notebook, and many many more smaller improvements,
so it is really a fully new program.

<P><A NAME="Requirements"></A>
<H3>
Requirements</H3>

<DL>Operating system
<LI>
OS/2 Warp 4.0 with FP#1 installed</LI>

<BR>or
<LI>
OS/2 Warp 3.0 with FP#35 installed</LI>
</DL>

<DL>TCP/IP
<LI>
TCP/IP 3.0 (comes with OS/2 Warp 3.0 Connect)</LI>

<BR>or
<LI>
TCP/IP 4.0 (comes with OS/2 Warp 4.0)</LI>

<BR>or
<LI>TCP/IP 4.1 (separate product)</LI>
</DL>
WPS is not required, therefore PU Monitor works with Filebar, Mshell or
PC/2 in WPS replacement modes.
<BR><A NAME="Installation"></A>
<H3>Installation</H3>
Installation of PU Monitor is simple. Just place executable file where
you want on the disk and create WPS Program object using any known method,
if required.
<BR><A NAME="Configuration"></A>
<H3>Configuration</H3>
PU Monitor is shown <A HREF="#Screenshot">at screen</A> as a small window,
divided into 4 sub windows. Each sub window has it's own purpose. Assignment
of sub windows from left to right:
<OL>
<LI>CPU Monitor</LI>
<LI>IP Monitor</LI>
<LI>Memory Monitor</LI>
<LI>Mailbox monitor</LI>
</OL>
<A NAME="Screenshot"></A><IMG SRC="pumon.gif" >

<P>Later these windows will be named by their assignment

<P>When you start PU Monitor for the first time, they are shown using default
configuration which may definitely different from what you want. To solve
this problem, just press right mouse button over PU Monitor window and
you'll see menu.
<OL>This menu consist from following items:

<UL>
<LI>Float on top.</LI>

<BR>Range: On/Off.

<P>This check box is responsible for switching on and off <B>Float on top</B>
feature of PU Monitor. Making them on gives PU Monitor ability to float
on top of all windows, even if they are maximized and therefore makes it
always visible.

<LI>Attach to Warp Center.</LI>

<BR>Range: On/Off.

<P>This check box is responsible for switching on and off <B>Attach to
Warp Canter</B> feature of PU Monitor. Making them on gives PU Monitor
ability to float on top of Warp Center window. Windows which overlaps Warp
Center overlaps also PU Monitor window. Also PU Monitor tries to follow
Warp Center Window as long as possible.
<BR><B>Note:</B> This feature is dependent from availability of Warp Center
window in <B>Window List</B>. Therefore, if you delete Warp Center from
this list, for example using Task Switcher from <A HREF="http://www.lab321.ru/~dip/sysbar2/">SysBar/2</A>
package, this feature would not work.

<LI>Lock in place.</LI>

<BR>Range: On/Off.

<P>This check box is responsible for switching on and off ability of PU
Monitor window to be dragged with left mouse button. You should note that
this check box is does not switch off the ability of PU Monitor window

<P><B>Note 1:</B>HiRes stands for High Resolution timer.
<BR>For more detailed information look at IBM DEVELOPER'S TOOLKIT FOR OS/2
WARP.

<P><B>Note 2:</B>Standard and High Resolution timers show slightly different
results, because High Resolution timer depends on the device driver which
is loaded during the boot sequence a few seconds later than the kernel
itself is started. Also, the using of DOS application (especially games)
can break results shown by this method.
<BR>Despite these disadvantages, this method is highly recommended for
computers with high uptimes, because it does not wrap values greater than
48 days.</UL>
