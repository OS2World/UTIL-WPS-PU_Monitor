                        PU Monitor v2.xx

            Copyright (C) 1998, 2002 Sergey I. Yevtushenko


    This is long awaited open source release of PU Monitor.
The first question is why I have decided to do so. The answer is simple:
I just have no time to move it forward. It is stable in the present
state and now is time to extend it, add new features, bells and whistles.
But I'm busy with other projects which are more interesting for me,
so I decided to release software for free and with full source code.

PU Monitor protected by "BSD-like" license. So, if you find sources
useful and will decide to use they in your own project (even commercial)
you're free to do so, just mention original copyright somewhere in
the documentaion.

To build PU Monitor from sources, you'll need Watcom C++ 10.6 and
MAKE utility from Borland C++ 2.0 for OS/2 (it is also provided with TASM 4.1).
There are no known dependencies on this tools so you may try to compile
sources by another compiler. All you'll need is to write new MAKEFILE.

Good luck.

Regards,
    Sergey.
